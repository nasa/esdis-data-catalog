# ESDIS Data Catalog

#### Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (check .nvmrc for correct version)
  - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is highly recommended

#### Running Data-Catalog locally

```bash
    npm run start
```

#### Local Testing

To run the test suite, run:

```bash
    npm run test
```

#### Build

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as its build tool. To build the project for production, follow these steps:

```bash
    npm run build
```

After the build process completes, you'll find the main output file `DataCatalog.js` in the `dist` directory. This file contains the compiled and bundled version of the Data Catalog application, ready for deployment.

To test the production build locally:

```bash
    npm run test-dist
```

This script will run the `npm run build` command, then start an http server in the `dist` directory that you can view at [http://127.0.0.1:8081/](http://127.0.0.1:8081/)
